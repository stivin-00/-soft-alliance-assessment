# Task Two: Data Fetching and Responsive Design

## Approach

- **UserCards**: 
  - Fetches a list of 6 users from the JSONPlaceholder API.
  - Displays user information in cards, with a responsive design that adjusts the number of columns based on the device width.
  

- **NewUserForm**: 
  - Provides a form for collecting user information.
  - Submits the form data as a new post to the API.
  - Displays the response from the API in a card without refreshing the page.
  - Shows pop up alert for both successfull and error response.

- **ResponsiveDesign**:
  - Implemented responsive design using `FlatList` and dynamic column calculation.
